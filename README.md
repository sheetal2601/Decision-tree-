# Decision-tree-


1. **Data Collection:** Gather a dataset with features like age, sex, blood pressure, etc., along with heart disease labels.

2. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and scaling features.

3. **Split Data:** Divide the dataset into a training set (70-80%) and a testing set (20-30%).

4. **Build Decision Tree:** Train a decision tree model using the training data and heart disease labels.

5. **Evaluate Model:** Make predictions on the test set and assess model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

6. **Tune Hyperparameters:** Adjust decision tree parameters like depth and leaf samples to optimize performance.

7. **Visualize (Optional):** Visualize the decision tree to understand feature importance and decision paths.

8. **Deploy (Optional):** If satisfactory, deploy the model for predictions, considering medical validation and expert input.

9. **Final** - Train Accuracy : 0.719576719576719 , Test Accuracy : 0.6172839506172839
